The project aimed to design a personalized product recommendation system for an e-commerce platform. The system uses machine learning techniques to suggest relevant products to users based on their browsing and purchase history, enhancing user experience and driving sales. For that, I used K-means clustering algorithm, Q-learning, Silhouette score, and Cosine Similarity Algorithm.
